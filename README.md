## Installation

We recommend you create a virtual environment in python in which to install this package.

```sh
cd ~/project/folder/
python -m venv env_name
```

Further instructions about virtual environment can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

Now, install the package with:

```sh
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/AAMIASoftwares-research/HCATNetwork.git
```

## For developers

For testing without always re-installing everything, create a ```venv-dev``` in the
main folder of this repo.

Each time changes are made, update the "version" field in the ```pyproject``` file.
